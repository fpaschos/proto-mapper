### Proto Mapper
Macro implementation library for mapping between custom models and protobuf generated code

#### Notice
This library is an (almost) complete rewrite of the [protobuf-convert](https://github.com/aleksuss/protobuf-convert/blob/master/README.md) library.
The purpose of the rewrite is to adapt it to specific needs of our projects.
The main concept and the idea remains the same, so the credit goes to the original authors of the `protobuf-convert` library.

#### What changed
This library: 
 - changes the main name of the macro to `ProtoMap`
 - changes the main way the macro is used and is interfaced with external traits
 - avoids the use of re implementing ProtoMap trait to client modules
 - is restructured to different crates 
 - contains extensive testing for edge cases
 - introduces ProtoScalar types
 - introduces ProtoScalarMap trait for protobuf scalar types
 - handles enumeration protobuf generation code automatically
 - handles option values via scanning the types of the applied struct and chooses different implementation paths
 - supports prost (WIP)
